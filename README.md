# le-godaddy-dns-pve

le-godaddy-dns-pve is a fork of le-godaddy-dns that automatically deploys new certificates to
Proxmox.

le-godaddy-dns is a [Let's encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) module,
designed to be used as a hook with
[letsencrypt.sh](https://github.com/lukas2511/letsencrypt.sh) for
[DNS-based validation](https://github.com/lukas2511/letsencrypt.sh/blob/master/docs/dns-verification.md)
against Godaddy DNS.

## Prerequisites

To use this module you will need the following:

* curl
* python3
* godaddypy python3 module
* [Production Godaddy API keys](https://developer.godaddy.com/keys/)
* OpenSSL (or basically whatever `letsencrypt.sh` depends on)

## Usage

**Before anything else: Back up your zone-file.**

You are letting a program meddle with your DNS. Bugs happen. Shit
happens. Be prepared.

First you need to download all dependencies and configure `letsencrypt.sh`.

````bash
# get dependencies
sudo apt-get install python3 python3-pip curl
python3 -m pip install --user godaddypy

# setup a workplace
ROOTDIR=$HOME/letsencrypt
mkdir -p $ROOTDIR
cd $ROOTDIR

# get letsencrypt.sh
git clone https://github.com/lukas2511/letsencrypt.sh
# get le-godaddy-dns
git clone https://github.com/josteink/le-godaddy-dns

# configure letsencrypt.sh
cd $ROOTDIR/letsencrypt.sh
nano domains.txt

# the format for domains.txt is documented in letsencrypt.sh's repo.
# https://github.com/lukas2511/letsencrypt.sh/blob/master/docs/domains_txt.md
cat domains.txt
mydomain.com sub.mydomain.com
example.com
...
````

Now you need to configure `le-godaddy-dns` and retrieve your certs.

````bash
# configure your API keys
export GD_KEY=your_key_here
export GD_SECRET=your_secret_here

# run letsencrypt.sh in "cron" mode (-c)
# this creates CSRs, keys and everything we need automatically for us.
./letsencrypt.sh --challenge dns-01 -k $ROOTDIR/le-godaddy-dns/godaddy.py -c

````

You should now have your certs, and the output should tell you where
they are.

You can put the last section in a script and add as a cronjob to
ensure your certificates gets auto-renewed.

You can optionally inspect that they look like they should

````bash
find . -name fullchain.pem -exec openssl x509 -in '{}' -text -noout \;
find . -name fullchain.pem -exec openssl x509 -in '{}' -subject -noout \;
````

You may also decide to customize the `deploy_certificates` hook in
`goddady.py` if you want the certificates automatically copied
to another destination than the one provided by `letsencrypt.sh`.

That said, it all works for me.
